# Hex

Hex was my first game at Stasism. I was tasked with creating a concept of a game that you could play through the webcam doing an exercise of clenching a fist and opening the hand. I developed an endless runner where the player controls a little witch collecting coins and power ups while avoiding obstacles.

Later on, I was requested to expand the game by adding more content to it. As an endless game does not give much room for expansion, I decided to add two different modes: timed mode and slip stream. Timed mode required the player to catch a certain amount of coins in a given period of time and both would vary according to the difficulty level. Slip stream, on the other hand, was a mode meant to get the player the thrill of getting closer and closer to the obstacles, without ever touching them, and getting a speed boost. The closer they got, the bigger the boost would be. One would have a required distance to be travelled within a time limit, also varying with the difficulty level. With this, Hex got its' first actual levels. A sequence of levels in different environments, with the three level types, growing in difficulty made Hex a more complete game. This version also received other control types, the name we would give to different exercises that could be used to control the game. Opening/closing the mouth, squats, turning the head, etc. After the new modes, I added custom levels. These were levels were the values (like frequency and position of obstacles, minimum and maximum speeds and speed increase, length of the level and other things) could be customized in case the players or their tutors wanted a more personalized playing session.
