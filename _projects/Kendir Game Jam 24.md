# It's not Pelican't, it's PeliCAN!

Kendir Game Jam '24 happened in the weekend of 6-8 September and had several different themes the teams could vote on. The selected theme was **Bloody Trees**. The secondary themes were released during the Jam and were **Fire** and **Emotions**. Due to the timing of the second secondary theme announcement, we couldn't integrate it.

It's not Pelican't, it's PeliCAN is a local co-op game for up to 6 players where you can use th keyboard and mouse or gamepads. Players take the role of fire fighting pelicans that have to protect the park. Fires will show up all around and start spreading in different patterns, either by spreading faster among the trees or in the direction of the wind.

For this Jam, I took the roles of programming and doing asset integration. I made the controls with Unity's New Input System, a multiplayer friendly camera (zooming and moving to include everyone), game loss conditions, UI, fire "waves", made players easier to distinguish by color coding the characters and auto aim. These final two tasks were made to show that accessibility can actually be easy (and quick to make, even in a Game Jam setting) and is a part of quality of life features.
