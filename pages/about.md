# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
A game developer with a special interest for Serious Games, engaging experiences and accessibility in games. I am a **Certified Accessible Player Experiences Practitioner** since 2023 and have consulted on a couple of small projects. I was an **invited guest** for a couple of lectures in Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto to talk about game accessibility.
